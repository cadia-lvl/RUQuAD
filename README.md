# RUQuAD
A repository with information about Reykjavik University Question-Answering Dataset (RUQuAD).

The first version of RUQuAD (RUQuAD 22.02) was collected in 2021-2022 by about 1,000 crowd-workers who used the [GameQA mobile app platform](https://github.com/cadia-lvl/GameQA) to generate 23,036 questions of which 20,730 passed a double peer review.  For these 20,730 questions, the crowd-workers annotated 12,722 answers, sourced from five sources in four separate domains: [The Icelandic Wikipedia](https://is.wikipedia.org/wiki/), [The Icelandic Web of Science](https://www.visindavefur.is/), the news websites [mbl.is](https://www.mbl.is/) and [visir.is](https://www.visir.is/), and [The Icelandic Government Information website](https://www.stjornarradid.is/).
